# Selenium + Playwright Python Automation Framework

A side-by-side comparison framework to learn and evaluate **Playwright** vs **Selenium** for browser automation.
This project is part of my learning journey as an automation engineer transitioning from Selenium to Playwright.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Build a Python test automation framework that supports both **Selenium** and **Playwright**
- Compare them using real-world test cases
- Use **Pytest**, **Page Object Model**, and other best practices
- Explore differences in speed, stability, setup, and test writing

---

## âœ… What's Included

- Reusable **Page Objects** for both frameworks
- Pytest-based test suite with shared fixtures
- Configurable driver selection (Selenium or Playwright)
- Structured folder layout for scalability
